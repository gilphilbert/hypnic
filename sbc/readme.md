## Hypnic Power Manager

### Software install
The install script is hosted on this GitHub site, simply log into your SBC (Raspberry Pi, etc.) and run the following command:
```bash
wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilphilbert/hypnic/main/sbc/install.sh | sudo bash
```
**NOTE** PiCorePlayer and Tiny Core Linux users will not have bash installed by default. Instead, use:
```sh
wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilphilbert/hypnic/main/sbc/install.sh | sudo sh
```
